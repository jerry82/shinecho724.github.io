Thank you very much for visiting my personal blog. I would like to use this blog as a hub to view my scholarly and professional works, social media profiles, and, most importantly, to share research ideas for furthering collabaration. 

Special notes:
This is a personal blog of B. Shine Cho, Ph.D., hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and built using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with the [lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme. The backbone of this blog emulated a great example of [Kyle Stratis's blog](http://kylestratis.com/).
